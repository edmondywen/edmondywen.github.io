                    I keep on getting the urge to write a musing but have not gotten around to it until now. it is currently 11:39am. I am sitting on my couch
                    listening to Clairo, drinking green tea, and eating a bowl of plain yogurt topped w/ sliced almonds + blueberries + honey. Yesterday I made
                    baked three cheese mac and cheese (cheddar, tj truffle cheese, parm) for friendsgiving at Chong's. It was well received.

                    Today I want to finish writing my Thanksgiving cards, visit Greenwood cemetary, I also need to pack a suitcase for tomorrow.

                    this is my first musing on this page. it is currently 5:34 pm at the office. I've been working on this little personal website for the past ~1.5 hrs.
                    I finished my fde related task earlier this morning but I'm not sure what my next steps are so I decided to work on this instead. Raymond, Boyu, and Saurav
                    are still in the office. I am killing time until Alan's birthday dinner at 7pm. There was jazz playing in the meatpacking plaza (idk its official name)
                    earlier. I dropped off my ballot today at the nearby post office. It is now 5:39 pm. What should I get Alan? This site is public so he could be reading this
                    ðŸ˜³. Hi Alan! Happy birthday! I think I'll take a walk.

                    I went to Chong's Pleasure Palace last night to watch Incantation. The F train home at 10:30pm last night was packed like a can of sardines. As of tomorrow,
                    I will have been in NYC for 3 months. I've experienced ridiculous emotional swings. Some days I feel devastatingly lonely. On others, I feel exhilarated. Today,
                    I feel alright.
