                        I read an excellent blog post today titled <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/2/escalating-streaks/">"Tom Scott, and the formidable power of escalating streaks"</a> written by Simon Willison.
                        It's a quick read and I highly recommend checking it out, but in effect, the post discusses the power of using streaks for self-improvement. To get good at anything, one needs to perform that thing regularly,
                        and thoughtfully with the goal of improving at it marginally each time. This is well-known, but the key takeaway for me was the importance of using a streak with <strong>leniancy</strong> built in.
                        For example, instead of setting a goal of running 1 mile each day, a more flexible but still well-defined goal would be to run 1 mile for 4/7 days of the week.

                        Since moving to New York, I've already accomplished a few things that I'm proud of. I've started regularly attending social events for chess and melee. I've been reaching out to both old and new friends,
                        expanding my social circle and skills. However, I feel that I can still do more. I feel as if I'm plateauing with many of my hobbies and have begun to accept mediocrity. For example, I go to the gym regularly
                        but haven't pushed myself to go more than 2-3 times a week, especially in the mornings. I'm leaving a lot of progress on the table as a result. To push myself, I will declare and document my streaks more visibly
                        on this page.

                            Update this page 3 times per week. An update can be very minimal. Benefits: Github square :star eyes:, improve web dev skills, improve writing, outlet for other creative projects like photography. accountable

                        I keep on getting the urge to write a musing but have not gotten around to it until now. it is currently 11:39am. I am sitting on my couch
                        listening to Clairo, drinking green tea, and eating a bowl of plain yogurt topped w/ sliced almonds + blueberries + honey. Yesterday I made
                        baked three cheese mac and cheese (cheddar, tj truffle cheese, parm) for friendsgiving at Chong's. It was well received.

                        Today I want to finish writing my Thanksgiving cards, visit Greenwood cemetary, I also need to pack a suitcase for tomorrow.

                    this is my first musing on this page. it is currently 5:34 pm at the office. I've been working on this little personal website for the past ~1.5 hrs.
                    I finished my fde related task earlier this morning but I'm not sure what my next steps are so I decided to work on this instead. Raymond, Boyu, and Saurav
                    are still in the office. I am killing time until Alan's birthday dinner at 7pm. There was jazz playing in the meatpacking plaza (idk its official name)
                    earlier. I dropped off my ballot today at the nearby post office. It is now 5:39 pm. What should I get Alan? This site is public so he could be reading this
                    ðŸ˜³. Hi Alan! Happy birthday! I think I'll take a walk.
                </p>

                    I went to Chong's Pleasure Palace last night to watch Incantation. The F train home at 10:30pm last night was packed like a can of sardines. As of tomorrow,
                    I will have been in NYC for 3 months. I've experienced ridiculous emotional swings. Some days I feel devastatingly lonely. On others, I feel exhilarated. Today,
                    I feel alright.
