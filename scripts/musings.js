I've been working on this little personal website for the past ~1.5 hrs. I finished my fde related task earlier this morning but I'm not sure what my next steps are so I decided to work on this instead. Raymond, Boyu, and Saurav are still in the office. I am killing time until Alan's birthday dinner at 7pm. There was jazz playing in the meatpacking plaza (idk its official name) earlier. I dropped off my ballot today at the nearby post office. It is now 5:39 pm. What should I get Alan? This site is public so he could be reading this ðŸ˜³. Hi Alan! Happy birthday! I think I'll take a walk. \n \n I went to Chong's Pleasure Palace last night to watch Incantation. The F train home at 10:30pm last night was packed like a can of sardines. As of tomorrow, I will have been in NYC for 3 months. I've experienced ridiculous emotional swings. Some days I feel devastatingly lonely. On others, I feel exhilarated. Today, I feel alright.");
